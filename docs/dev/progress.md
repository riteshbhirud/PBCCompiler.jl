# Progress log: verification and resource estimation

Work is on the local `dev` branch, created from `riteshbhirud/PBCCompiler.jl`
`master` at `ed0efec`. Nothing has been pushed.

## M0: Codebase map

- Wrote `docs/dev/codebase_map.md`. It covers every `CircuitOp` variant with exact
  semantics, the entry points and passes, printed compiled outputs (single T,
  CNOT+T, QFT-2, and stats for the repo fixture), the utilities, and the exact
  gadget shape.
- Every convention was checked numerically with a dense-matrix script, not read off
  docstrings:
  - rotations are `exp(-iθP)`;
  - bit = 1 means eigenvalue −1;
  - the gadget implements `exp(-iπ/8 P)` with `|m⟩ = T|+⟩` in all 4 branches;
  - `(A*B)(p) = A(B(p))` for `CliffordOperator`.
- Found 6 compiler issues (B1–B6). Each was reproduced before being written down,
  and they are recorded in `docs/NOTES_FOR_COMPILER.md`.
- Deviations recorded:
  - the default semantics is `:outcomes`, not the full channel;
  - there is no QFT-4 in the repo and it is not exact in Clifford+T;
  - the Pauli frame is tracked without a sign;
  - `PrepMagic` is unsupported (no defined semantics).
- Tests: the existing suite was run before starting and passed 178/178. M0 adds no
  code.
